**To-Do**
Import csv file and store it in a list or array of a certain class from which we can then access "Forename, Surname, Date of Birth etc"
Customer - store customer data
Vehicle - store vehicle data plus their owners id "Customer ID"
Also to the customers list don't add the same customer twice (Optional)

**Improvements**
We could use visual basic TextFileParser in case we have would have multiple rows or special text to display	
We could also add an option to view vehicles by color
							   view vehicles with "HasHelmetStorage"
							   view vehicles by manufacturer
							   view vehicles from a certain year
							   view motorcycles or cars
